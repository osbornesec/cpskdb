# CPSKDB Project Overview

## Project Purpose

CPSKDB is an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed
for multi-product technical data. It's a locally-deployed, enterprise-grade
system that provides instant, accurate, and contextually-aware answers to
complex technical queries while maintaining complete data privacy.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent orchestration for specialized query handling
- Hybrid vector and keyword search with semantic understanding
- Local LLM inference (Ollama with GPT-OSS-20B)
- Version-aware retrieval for product documentation
- Cross-product intelligence for integration scenarios
- Complete data privacy with on-premises deployment
- Auditable responses with traceable citations

## Target Users

- Technical Support Engineers
- Field Application Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Product Managers
- Technical Documentation Teams

## Success Metrics

- ≥95% response accuracy grounded in documentation
- P50 latency ≤2s for retrieval, ≤5s end-to-end
- Support for 100+ concurrent users
- 90% user satisfaction score

## Current Project Status

The project is in the initial setup phase (Phase 0: Foundations). Currently
only the CLAUDE.md configuration file exists, with the full project
structure and implementation pending.
